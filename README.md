# Netgen Layouts 0.13 to 1.0 upgrade script

This script is not a drop-in replacement for official [upgrade](https://docs.netgen.io/projects/layouts/en/latest/upgrades/upgrade_0130_100.html) procedure. 
Instead, it tries to simplify the upgrade process by automatizing some upgrade steps.

It is tested with `find` and `sed` commands that are distributed with Mac OS.

The official upgrade procedure is documented [here](https://docs.netgen.io/projects/layouts/en/latest/upgrades/upgrade_0130_100.html).
